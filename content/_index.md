> *"The difference between a novice and a master is that the master has failed more times than the novice has tried."*

Hey there! 👋 I'm a `Security Engineer` with a passion for `Red Teaming`. My journey started deep in the world of `CTF Cryptography`, which became the foundation for everything I do today.

### What I Do

- 🎯 **Offensive Security** — Proficient in `Windows` and `Linux` Red Teaming, with hands-on experience in evasion techniques and custom exploit development.

- ☁️ **Cloud Security** — Specialist in `Cloud Red Teaming`, primarily on `GCP` and `GKE`.

- 🏗️ **Architecture** — Good grasp of system design and networking, helping me understand attack surfaces better.

- ⛓️ **Web3** — Familiar with blockchain security basics as a side interest.

### Vision

Currently growing towards `System Architecture` — designing secure-by-default infrastructures.

Beyond engineering, I'm passionate about **education**. Like `Koro-sensei`, I believe in sharing knowledge to help cultivate the next generation of security professionals.
